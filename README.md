# Python Average Calculator

A small Python script that calculates the average of numeric scores entered by the user.

---

## Description

This project demonstrates how to process user input, convert data types, and perform basic calculations in Python.
The user enters multiple scores separated by spaces, and the program calculates and displays the average value.

---

## How It Works

1. The user enters scores as a single line of input.
2. The input string is split into individual values.
3. Each value is converted to a floating-point number.
4. The program calculates the total and computes the average.
5. The result is printed with two decimal places.

## Example

Input:
18 17.5 20 16


Output:
Your average mark is: 17.88
